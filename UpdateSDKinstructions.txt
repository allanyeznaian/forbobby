If you are updating from sdk 35 or 36 this is how it worked for me

open pangeareact folder with console
try npm install -g expo-cli
    if that worked, run npm install and open the app

if that doesn't work or if you get the 
permissions issue and sudo npm install -g expo-cli doesn't work~

go to where your global npm data is stored~
    for me it was in C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming
        delete the npm and npm-cache folders
        uninstall and reinstall node.js
        try npm install -g expo-cli again 

if that worked then run npm install and the app should be updated
